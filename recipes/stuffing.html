    <p>Description: The stuffing is lightly crusted and golden on top, soft underneath, 
        full of rich buttery flavor, and well-seasoned from the herbs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Broth</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250F. Place cubed bread on a baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 45 minutes. You must begin with very dry bread or it’ll turn to mush. Tip – To save time on the day of, bake and dry out the bread the night before and leave uncovered on the counter until the morning you’re ready to make the stuffing.
        </li>
        <li>When you’re ready to make the stuffing, transfer bread to a very large bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F and spray a 9×13-inch pan or 3-quart baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>To a large skillet, add 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter and heat over medium-high heat to melt.
        </li>
        <li>Add the onions, celery, and cook until vegetables have softened and are just beginning to lightly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir frequently. Transfer vegetables to bowl with bread.
        </li>
        <li>Add the parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, and toss well to combine; set aside. Note about salt – the saltiness level of low-sodium chicken broth varies, and so do personal preferences, so salt to taste.
        </li>
        <li>To a small bowl, add the remaining 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, 2 eggs, and whisk to combine. Pour mixture over bread and toss well to combine. Turn mixture out into prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Dice the remaining 1/4 cup (half of 1 stick) butter into 8 to 10 pieces and evenly dot the butter over the top of the stuffing.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is as lightly golden browned as desired. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
